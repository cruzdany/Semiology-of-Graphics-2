    "## Chapter 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1 According to the book, how information is defined?\n",
    "It is a series of correspondences observed within a finite set of variational concepts of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 When a component is ordered?\n",
    "When its categories are ordered in a single and universal manner, and when its categories are defined as equidistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 When a component is quantitative?\n",
    "When its object is to specify the variation in distance among the categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 How does efficiency is described according to its preposition?\n",
    "If, in order to obtain a correct and complete answerto a given question,all other things being equal, one construction requires a shorter period of perception than another construction, we can Say thatit is more efficient for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5 Mention the three levels of organization of a component?\n",
    "Qualitative, ordered, or quantitative. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6 When a component is quantitative?\n",
    "When its object is to specify the variation in distance among the categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1 When is used ordered perception?\n",
    "It is used when we are comparing two or several orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 When is used quantitative perception?\n",
    "It is used when we are seekking to define numerically the ratio between two signs. Also when we seek to group homogeneous signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Mention the 4 leves of a variable\n",
    "Selective, associative, ordered, and quantitative. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 What is a point? \n",
    "It is a location on the plane that has no theoretical length or area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5 What signifies area according to the book?\n",
    "It is something on the plane that has a measurable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6 What does the frame of a graphic delimits of?\n",
    "It delimits the signifying space, but it does not necessarily delimit the phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chapter 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What is called an image?\n",
    "The meaningful visual form, perceptible in the minimum instant of vision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. When is needed to use graphic representation?\n",
    "When reducing the comprehensive, nonmemorizable inventory to a simplified, memorizable message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is the new information produced in cartographic representation?\n",
    "The density, which is the relationship of the numbers to geographic area\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. When can we use a distribution curve in graphics?\n",
    "When the information is not known for each element, but only by classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5 What is retinal separation?\n",
    "It is separating the meaningful marks from the meaningless ones and, within each retinal variable, separate the steps in order to avoid and image which is too weak or too bold. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6 When is needed to use plane and its visual signs in communicating information?\n",
    "When we intednt to create memorizable image which inscribes the overall information within the field of assimilated knowledge. "
